# OurPulse

OurPulse is a project to perform a simple sentiment analysis of current events by analyzing tweets.

This is very much a work in progress. However, if you make a `.env` file with a field `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN` (and setting it's value to a valid Twitter bearer token) you will be able to analyze 10 tweets at a time with the only other modification being your search query.
